# In Nutshell
 Deployed here : https://kuldeep-kumar-sharma.github.io/smart-hardware-shop-assignment/
 - localserver need to be started to see the demo also - as I don't want to expose your assignment
 - Adding to cart might take while to show, try adding more products - not able to fully understand why redux is that much time.
 - Only one test case is added, but I might add more later
 - Otherwise it works fine
